Notes and tools for looking at AMD Platform Security Processor (PSP) binaries.

- [docs/](./docs) - Notes on various things
- [bin/](./bin) - Scripts

This is really only relevant to firmware images for Family 17h platforms, 
mostly because at some point (probably with the release of Family 19h?), many 
[but not all?] PSP-related binaries embedded in AGESA BIOS images started being 
distributed as encrypted blobs.
